# 🚗 YOLOv8 License Plate Detection Model

This repository contains a YOLOv8 object detection model trained to detect **license plates** in real-world images. The model was trained using the [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) YOLOv8 framework and can be deployed for real-time applications such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and vehicle identification.

## 🔧 How to Use

Install dependencies first:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

## Example usage:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load model from HF
