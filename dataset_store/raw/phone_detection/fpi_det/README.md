## Dataset Overview

![MoPho-Det Example Image](/fpi_main_pic.png)
We are pleased to announce the open sourcing of the **FPI-Det** dataset. This dataset is specifically designed for detecting mobile phone usage behavior from surveillance perspectives.

- **Total Number of Images**: 22,879
- **Total Number of Annotations**: 39,534
  - **Head Annotations**: 29,279
  - **Phone Annotations**: 10,255
  - **Extend Classification Task Annotations**: 4,079

### Dataset Features

1. **Head Annotations**: The dataset includes additional annotations for heads, enhancing the accuracy of detecting users engaged with mobile phones.
2. **Data Cleaning and Correction**: Original dataset has been cleaned and corrected, ensuring high data quality for subsequent research and development.
3. **Professional Applications**: Suitable for precise detection of user mobile phone behavior and supports distance-based hard sample mining.

## Download and Usage

## Tasks

This project includes two tasks: **detection task** and **classification task**. For the classification task, an additional table `label.csv` is provided for validating results, allowing comparison of the final classifications with detection results. The `result.csv` and other CSV files serve as examples, which can be used alongside `label.csv` in `calculate_metrics.py` to compute final metrics. The `simple_classify_images.py` script can be utilized to derive classification results from detection outcomes and automatically generate prediction tables.
